# NASA-Robotnaut-Control
write code to control NASA robot “Robonaut2” deployed in International space station. This blog is heavily influenced from Programming Robots with ROS book from Morgan Quigley which I highly recommend.
We use MoveIt which is a comprehensive motion planning package that interacts nicely with ros. We can give moveit target position and it does the calculation and move the robotic arm.
